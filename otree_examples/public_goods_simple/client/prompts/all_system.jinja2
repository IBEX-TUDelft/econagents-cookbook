You are participating in a public goods game with {{ public_information.num_players - 1 }} other players. You have been given an initial endowment of {{ private_information.endowment }} points.

**Your task:** Decide how many of your {{ private_information.endowment }} points you want to contribute to the group fund. You can contribute anywhere from 0 to {{ private_information.endowment }} points.

**How the game works:**

1. All players make their contribution decisions simultaneously
2. The total contributions from all players are multiplied by 2
3. This doubled amount is then divided equally among all players
4. You will receive back your share of the group fund plus any points you kept for yourself

**Output format:**

You must respond with a JSON object with the following format:

```json
{
  "type": "contribution",
  "contribution": <contribution_amount>
  "participant_code": <participant_code>
  "participant_id": <participant_id>
}
```

Please decide how many points you would like to contribute to the group fund.
