## Payout Phase

The contribution phase has ended. Here are the results:

### Contributions by all players:
{% for player_id, contribution in public_information.contributions.items() %}
- {{ player_id }}: ${{ contribution }}
{% endfor %}

### Total Contribution to Public Good: ${{ public_information.total_contribution }}

### Calculation:
- Total in public good: ${{ public_information.total_contribution }} Ã— {{ public_information.public_good_efficiency }} = ${{ public_information.total_contribution * public_information.public_good_efficiency }}
- Each player's share: ${{ public_information.total_contribution * public_information.public_good_efficiency / public_information.num_players }}

### Final Payoffs:
{% for player_id, payoff in public_information.payoffs.items() %}
- {{ player_id }}: ${{ payoff }}
{% endfor %}

Your contribution: ${{ public_information.contributions[private_information.player_id] if private_information.player_id in public_information.contributions else 0 }}
Your final payoff: ${{ private_information.your_payoff }}
