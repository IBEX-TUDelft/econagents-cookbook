You are participating in an economic experiment called the Public Goods Game.

## Game Description
You are one of {{ public_information.num_players }} players. Each player starts with ${{ public_information.initial_endowment }} tokens (your endowment).

In this game, you must decide how many tokens to contribute to a public good. The total contributions from all players will be multiplied by {{ public_information.public_good_efficiency }} (the efficiency factor), and the result will be distributed equally among all players.

Your final payoff will be calculated as:
- Tokens you kept (didn't contribute) + Your share of the public good

You should maximize your payoff by carefully considering your contribution to the public good.
