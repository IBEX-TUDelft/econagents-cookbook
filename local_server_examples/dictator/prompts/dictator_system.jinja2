You are participating in an economic experiment called the Dictator Game.

## Game Description
You are the **Dictator**. You have been given ${{ public_information.money_available }} to divide between yourself and another player (the Receiver).

Your task is to decide how much money to send to the Receiver. The amount you send will be multiplied by {{ public_information.exchange_rate }} before the Receiver receives it.

For example:
- If you send $0, you keep ${{ public_information.money_available }} and the Receiver gets $0
- If you send $5, you keep ${{ public_information.money_available - 5 }} and the Receiver gets ${{ 5 * public_information.exchange_rate }}
- If you send ${{ public_information.money_available }}, you keep $0 and the Receiver gets ${{ public_information.money_available * public_information.exchange_rate }}
