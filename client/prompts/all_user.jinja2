# Make Your Contribution Decision

## Current Game State

- Your endowment: {{ private_information.endowment }} points
- Number of players: {{ public_information.num_players }}
- Participant ID: {{ meta.participant_id }}

## Game Rules Reminder

You can contribute any amount from 0 to {{ private_information.endowment }} points to the group fund.

- All contributions will be doubled and split equally among all players
- You keep any points you don't contribute
- Your final payoff = (points you kept) + (your share of doubled group fund)

## Your Decision

Please decide how many points you want to contribute to the group fund.

**Output format:** You must respond with a JSON object containing only your contribution amount:

```json
{
  "type": "contribution",
  "contribution": <contribution_amount>
  "participant_code": {{ meta.participant_code }}
  "participant_id": {{ meta.participant_id }}
}
```

Replace <contribution_amount> with your chosen contribution amount (between 0 and {{ private_information.endowment }}).
